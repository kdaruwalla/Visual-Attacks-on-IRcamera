Notes for what were gunna do going forward

First of all, we are going to have the camera capture 10 images in a "stream" - these images will represent live video

the image will get written in a file on jakes comptuers desktop , and should represent the stream of video in captures

on the server side, when the images come in, they will get written to new files, and we will use inter corelation to verify between those captures 

For the first attack: copy and paste, we will overite the 5th image with something rsandom befofre it gets sent to the server side.
Then when it goes into the frame correlation function, it should be detected as false.

For the second attack: copy and paste forgery attack, we will take the first captured image, store it on the MCU side, nd then we will overwrite the 5th image with that. 
Hopefully the interframe correlation function will still be able to detect this, but maybe not.
